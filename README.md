1. _(Not directly related to this project but worth a look)_ Also from the author of t-STE, **t-SNE** is a technique for reducing data dimensions. It is said to be superior to traditional methods, such as PCA, and is widely used in machine learning field. Please refer to the author's <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/" target="_blank">website</a>.

1. _(Not directly related to this project but worth a look)_ An interesting <a href="https://www.galaxyzoo.org/#/" target="_blank">website</a> built for **Galaxy Zoo**, a project aiming at categorizing galaxies. This website makes people answer simple multi-choice questions for tagging galaxies by their shapes, density, and other visual characteristics. Similar to the website idea we talk about today.
