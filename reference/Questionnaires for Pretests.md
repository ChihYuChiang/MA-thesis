This is the triplet survey by Qultrics with some JS (for the final project of the Content Analysis). My thesis survey could expand on that, preserving and tuning the triplet part while adding the player trait section.  
There are **test questions** for verifying if respondents have really played the games they specified. For the **answer keys**, please refer to the [core games.xlsx](/core games.xlsx) file.
