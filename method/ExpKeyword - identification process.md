Together with the video game expert review texts, the **experiential keywords** listed in [this file](MAPSS-Thesis\method\ExpKeyword%20-%20word%20list.csv) are going to be used to **describe video game experience**. The identification process of the list is as follows:

1. From the OED definition of `experience`, I identify certain **search terms**. (For now, they include `feel`, `emotion`, `experience`, `encounter`, `aware`, `mind`, `sens`, `state`, etc., around 20 words.)
2. In Unabridged Webster Dictionary, I inversely look-up these **search terms** in definitions and example sentences for around 1,500 **root keywords**. For example, use `emotion`, I find `happy`, `sad`, `regret`, etc.
3. Using [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) (a lexical database curated by Princeton), I expand the **root keywords** by adding lemmas, hyponyms, hypernyms, antonyms, and pertainyms to acquire the keyword list.
